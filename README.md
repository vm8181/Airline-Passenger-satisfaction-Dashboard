# Airline-Passenger-satisfaction-Dashboard

## Introduction:
The dashboard is created using BI tool Power BI. The dashboard represents the analysis of how many customers are satisfied with services provided by airline and distributed the analysis in the different parts by gender, class, ages and so on. I have created two different views on the same page by using toggle button by which you can change the view and site of information.
